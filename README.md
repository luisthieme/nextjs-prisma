## Getting Started

The only command that you should need to start the application is `docker compose up`.
Note that you have to install docker first.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Windows "no such file or directory"

If you are using a windows machine open the `start.sh` file with vscode. Click on the button on the bottom right of your screen marked with `CRLF`. Now change the encoding of the file to `LF`. After that you can run `docker compose up`.
